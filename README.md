# Movie Cast Crossover
This code uses the IMDB api, which I had to make a free account to use. I know this already exists in the form of the 
little known search engine askJ...Google but I thought this could be a bit of fun to:
- [x] Have a play around with using/accessing api's.
- [x] Try out streamlit to experiment with making a 'gui' in an easy way.

Also, I'm aware this would make more sense as a web page that could be hosted but as it states above  this is more for a bit if fun.

## Requirements
The requirements are written in the `requirements.txt` file. The main only install in streamlit and this should work with 
most versions of python and streamlit as it is pretty basic.

## Instructions
Within the repository folder `movieCastCrossover` run in a terminal:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Then type in 2 movies as accurately as possible and then your imbd API key and
press the search button.
