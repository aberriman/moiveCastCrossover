# Movie Cast Crossover
This code uses the IMDB api, which I had to make a free account to use. I know this already exists in the form of the 
little known search engine askJ...Google but I thought this could be a bit of fun to:
- [ ] Have a play around with using/accessing api's.
- [ ] Try out streamlit to experiment with making a 'gui' in an easy way.

Also, I'm aware this would make more sense as a web page that could be hosted but as it states above  this is more for a bit if fun.
